glitchiO is a piece of generative Pocket Art for mobile phones and tablets that explores the space inside randomness and glitch. It is inspired by the analogue VHS tape noise of damaged video cassettes and dirty playback heads on domestic VCRs. Reimagining this space for contemporary digital media and mobile phones glitchiO is a contemplation and treatise on what it is to hear machines speak in the interstitial spaces between human defined functions.

Using touch gestures and accelerometer you can navigate the visual world of noise, glitch, randomness and higher stochastic functions.

Inputs for exploration:

• swipe up/down for glitch width
• swipe left/right for glitch height
• single tap to toggle frame rate jittering on/off
• double tap to toggle colour/black and white
• tilt left/right to change colour intensity
